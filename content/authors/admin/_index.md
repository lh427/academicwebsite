I'm a research fellow at the University of Bristol, where my current work focuses on predictors of mental health problems for autistic children and young people. I'm also interested in masking/camouflaging in autism, and in how to improve the autism diagnostic process.

I am the co-creator of the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q), a self-report tool to measure camouflaging/masking of autistic traits. The CAT-Q is a free-to-use tool which can be used to help autistic people better understand their experience of camouflaging. It can also be used in research, and in clinical assessments as part of a broader range of diagnostic and mental health assessment tools.
